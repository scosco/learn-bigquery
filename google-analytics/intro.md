# Introduction

In the course of this training we'll be using the openly available Google Analytics data on the project [bigquery-public-data](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=&folder&organizationId&p=bigquery-public-data&d=google_analytics_sample&page=dataset). Note, that BigQuery allows to [pin projects](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bigquery-web-ui#pinning_adding_a_project) for easy access.

You'll want to consult the documentation on the [table schema](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3437719) while practicing. It's useful to bookmark this page to have it easily available.
